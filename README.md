# AI Lab - Image Generation Test

This project demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to generate images from text prompts using Node.js. The script generates an image based on a prompt suitable for a children's book and saves the result as a PNG file.

## Features

- Uses the OpenAI API to generate images from text prompts.
- Saves the generated image as a PNG file.
- Utilizes environment variables for API key management.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
3. Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Usage
Run the image generation script:

```bash
node image_generation_test.js
 ```

This will generate an image based on the prompt and save it as kid-studying.png in the project directory.

## Files
- image_generation_test.js : Main script for generating images.
- .env : Stores your OpenAI API key (not included in version control).
- kid-studying.png : Output image generated by the script.
